Federo is a display webfont that references Jakob Erbar's Feder Grotesk. The goal was to keep the typeface as close as possible to the original 1909 design while adapting it for crisp web typography. Details were refined and contrast was slightly reduced for consistency. Figures obtained regular proportions and counters were increased for better legibility.

Designed by Olexa Volochay in 2011. 

Federo is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and 
could be expanded to support other scripts.
